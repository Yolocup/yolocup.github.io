<h1 style="text-align: left;">Match rules:</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">
	- A referee creates a lobby 10 minutes beforehand, after which players receive an invite. Players can join up to 10 minutes after the start of the match. If no good reason is given for absence, the party present automatically wins.<br>
	- If both players are not present after 10 minutes, this is considered a forfeit from both sides.<br>
	- Players may each choose a warmup map under 4 minutes before the start of the match (not mandatory).<br>
	- After warmups, both players roll to determine the pick/ban order. The winner of the roll may pick 1st/2nd pick/ban first; the loser may pick 1st/2nd of what remains. Banning is not mandatory.<br>
	- You may pick the same mod multiple times in a row, no problem.<br>
	- In case of an (exact) equal score, the map will be replayed.<br>
	- For freemod: allowed mods are HD, HR, EZ and FL, combining is allowed.<br>
</p>
<h1 style="text-align: left;">Bonus rule:</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">
	- Each player gets 1 powerup per match, which can be chosen at any pick except the tiebreaker. Exactly what the powerups mean is still being looked into. This is experimental and exciting ðŸ˜³<br>
	- The powerups may include: Win conditions based on accuracy, highest combo, end combo, etc.<br>
</p>
